ohnoerik's Advent of Code 2023!
===============================

This repository is going to host my attempts at the Advent of Code.

For kicks and giggles, I'm going to try doing mine in various
IaC Languages/Markup(ish?).

I'm going to start off with some Terraform, maybe try some Helm,
and who knows. I *think* CloudFormation can maybe be wrangled into
working as a solution? (I'm kidding... I hope?)

I'm probably not going to have a solution for every day since I need
to maintain some resemblance of sanity.

Warning
-------
If you're actually using this repo to do anything production-worthy in
Terraform/Helm/etc., please turn around. Go back to Google, Kagi, Bing,
DuckDuckGo, or literally anywhere else and ignore the fact that this
repo exists.
